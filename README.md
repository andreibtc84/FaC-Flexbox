# Project Gallery

Create a project gallery which uses a flexbox layout. You’ll need to add a container to keep each element and use properties such as justify-content, align-items, and flex-wrap to display the elements on the page.

Your project gallery could feature some of the websites you’ve built already while working through the application requirements.
